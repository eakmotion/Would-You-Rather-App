Would You Rather app is an app that allows you to play the "Would You Rather?" game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?". Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In the app, you will be able to answer questions, see which questions you haven't answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The projects demonstrates the understanding of React, Redux, props, states, Components, JSX, AJAX, and JavaScript(ECMAScript) 6.
